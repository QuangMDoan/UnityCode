Brian sat on his front doorstep. He really wanted a new bike. Joe had just gotten one for his birthday, and Tyler's was only about a year old. Brian has his for 5 years.

The seat was up as high as it could go, and his legs were still too long. Brian wanted a bike just like Joe's or Tyler's. Their bike's were perfect for popping wheelies and
cruising over bumps. If only he had $110.00. all he could come up with was $ 33.67. Where could he get the rest of the money he needed ?

Brian thought and thought. His birhtday was still 5 months away, and he was too long too mow lawns. What could he do to get the money? 
maybe his dad would advance him his allowance for the next few months.

He got three dollars each friday if he did all his chores. His dad agreed to do this once before, when he needed a extra six dollars. Maybe his sister would loan him the money.
She had alot of money saved up from baby sittng.

Baby Sitting! That's it! Brian could babysit. Oops! wait a minute. No one would hire Brian to babysit. He still was not allowed to stay by himself yet. 
What could he do to get the money?

Brian sat and thought. Just then, the phone rang. Mrs Timmons' dog had gotten out again. She asked Brian if he could find Fifi for her. Brian said he would happpy to help Mrs 
Timmons again.

She was getting so old. She could not run for feisty Fifi anymore. Brian immediately started looking for Fifi. He spotted her immediately in the Kirbys' yard. After chasing Fifi
through three different yards, Brian finally caught the frisky dog.

He returned her to Mrs. Timmons. Mrs Timmons was so thankful that she haanded Brian 2 dollars. Brian thanked Mrs. Timmons. He told her she did not have to pay him. Then brian 
had an idea. 

Now he knew what he could do to earn money. He would set up a pet service! He could take care of people's pets when they were gone. He figured there were at l2 dogs he could
look after, a few cats, and even some fish.

Brian would have that bike in no time.
